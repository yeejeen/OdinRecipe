<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dumplings are delicate, bite-sized treats of different fillings wrapped in a thin layer of dough. They can be both savoury and sweet, and may be boiled, steamed and fried.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped Chinese chives</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha)</li>
        <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped Chinese chives</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>50 dumpling wrappers</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare dipping sauce: Combine soy sauce, rice vinegar, chives, sesame seeds, and chile sauce in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Prepare dumplings: Mix pork, garlic, egg, chives, soy sauce, sesame oil, and ginger in a large bowl until thoroughly combined.</li>
    <li>Place a dumpling wrapper on a lightly floured work surface and spoon about 1 tablespoon of the filling in the middle.</li>
    <li>Wet the edge with a little water and crimp together forming small pleats to seal the dumpling. Repeat to form remaining dumplings.</li>
    <li>Heat 1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place 8 to 10 dumplings in the pan and cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side.</li>
    <li>Pour in 1 cup of water; cover and cook until the dumplings are tender and pork is cooked through, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Repeat to cook remaining dumplings, adding more oil and water for each batch.</li>
    <li>Serve dumplings with dipping sauce.</li>
